## Skin Disease Classification

Skin diseases like acne, skin redness, and bags under the eyes are prevalent and can significantly impact individuals' self-esteem and quality of life.

Accurately diagnosing and classifying these conditions from images can be challenging due to variations in skin types, lighting conditions, and angles.

The dataset comprises images of individuals with various skin conditions, including acne, skin redness, and bags under the eyes.

Each person is represented by three images showcasing their specific skin issue, captured from different angles: front, left side, and right side.

we develop a robust deep learning model for the automatic classification of skin diseases from facial images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to assist dermatologists and skincare professionals in accurate and timely diagnosis.
